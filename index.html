									<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/279140/" target="_blank">Making History: The Great War</a> (TGW) is
									a turn based grand strategy game set during the events of World War I. The game features different scenarios that start at
									different dates around the beginning and (with a recently released DLC) end of the war. Any nation in the game is playable and
									the game features full multiplayer and mod support.
								</p>
								<p>
									I joined Muzzy Lane after work on TGW had already begun and after the game's initial early access release on steam. My role
									was to finish feature/system implementation and to improve and expand upon both the economic and military AI. Soon after joining,
									I effectively took ownership of these systems and pushed for a feature complete release in January 2015. For my work, I was credited 
									as lead engineer. Developmental work on TGW continued until mid-summer 2015, where I focused primarily on new features for the recently
									released DLC <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/402660/" target="_blank">The Red Army</a>.

							As a graduate student at the University of Arizona, I used Zeus-MP to simulate accretion disks around
							black holes. Zeus-MP is a popular 3D massively parallel radiation magneto-hydrodynamics code. 
							It was originally developed by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJS...80..753S" target=_blank>Stone and Norman</a>
							and later modified by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..165..188H" target=_blank>Hayes et. al</a> 
							to utilize MPI for parallel computing. 
							By using generic metrics, the equations solved therein are independent of any specific 
							geometry, making the code versatile enough to easily handle different geometries. Additionally, Zeus-MP's
							inclusion of both magnetic fields and radiation makes the code versatile enough to handle many different
							Astrophysical fluids problems. 
						</p> 
						<p>
							Using the hydro and radiation modules of Zeus-MP, we set out to determine what effects
							radiation pressure have on the rates at which black holes devour gas and grow. This project involved an 
							enormous amount of effort to develop a self-consistent model with which to feed gas into the system
							as well as an appropriate way to build the accretion disk while maintaining stability within the code.
						</p>
						<p>
							Using the Steele cluster at Purdue university, I ran several different simulations with varying gas inflow rates
							and free-free emission strengths. The results of one such run are stored 
							<a href="http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~pjenks/fstart/noVisc/f100/k1/" target=_blank>here</a>. The following figure
							and video show the gas inflow rate at ~40 blackhole radii normalized by a theoretical maximum and a log-density plot 
							(with velocity arrow overlays) of the simulation respectively. The original .mpg version of the video is available
							<a href="media/vel.mpg" target="_blank">here</a>.
