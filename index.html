						<p>
							After finishing my undergraduate degree in Physics with a minor in Math at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, 
							I decided to pursue a doctoral degree in Astrophysics 
							at the University of Arizona. I spent my time in graduate school attending classes, teaching undergraduates, and researching theoretical 
							astrophysics. I have a deep interest in theoretical physics, but I found the most rewarding part of my time at graduate school was spent 
							working with software. In fact, I came to realize that the accomplishments of which I was most proud had come from interesting and 
							challenging problems I encountered while working with code. Despite having passed my PhD qualifiers, 
							I decided to leave the PhD program with a Masters in Physics and to pursue a career in software. 
						</p>
						<P>
							Given my passion for games and gaming, I decided to pursue work in game programming and joined Muzzy Lane to work on their upcoming release
							Making History: The Great War (TGW). I spent close to a year working on implementing, improving, and optimizing the game's systems and AI. 
							TGW was a passion project for Muzzy Lane. Their main focus is building educational games for higher education, corporate training, and 
							non-traditional students. Given Muzzy Lane's small team, this gave me an opportunity to take ownership over many of the systems I worked
							on, which led to me being credited as Lead Engineer for the game. Soon after the release of TGW in 2015, Muzzy Lane shifted its focus
							to providing a robust web-based game creation toolkit for businesses and instructional designers. I specialized in building customized game
							simulation templates for a wide variety of subjects including hospital administration and WWI history. This work was incredibly rewarding in
							that it presented a particular challenge of providing robust and dynamic authoring software while also implementing detailed simulations.
						</p>
						<p>
							As my girlfriend finished law school this spring, we were presented with a new opportunity to pursue careers in the San Francisco
							Bay Area. After much consideration, we decided to leave New England and pursue this new opportunity. I enjoy gaming,
							music, and science. I am particularly interested in simulation, systems, and abstract programming and problem solving and am hoping to find a 
							career that meets these interests.

									<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/279140/" target="_blank">Making History: The Great War</a> (TGW) is
									a turn based grand strategy game set during the events of World War I. The game features different scenarios that start at
									different dates around the beginning and (with a recently released DLC) end of the war. Any nation in the game is playable and
									the game features full multiplayer and mod support.
								</p>
								<p>
									I joined Muzzy Lane after work on TGW had already begun and after the game's initial early access release on Steam. My role
									was to finish feature/system implementation and to improve and expand upon both the economic and military AI. Soon after joining,
									I effectively took ownership of these systems and pushed for a feature complete release in January 2015. For my work, I was credited 
									as lead engineer. Developmental work on TGW continued until mid-summer 2015, where I focused primarily on new features for the recently
									released DLC <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/402660/" target="_blank">The Red Army</a>.

										Smart Sim is my most recent project with Muzzy Lane. Designed to be used with 
										<a href="http://www.muzzylane.com/2015/11/muzzy-lane-author-faq/" target="_blank">Muzzy Lane's Author service</a>,
										Smart Sim is a fully authorable game template intended to be used by instructional designers as an education and assessment
										tool. In addition to building the game client and backend, I also built a fully featured web-based editor that gives 
										authors full control over game variables and behavior.
										The author creates game variables and can choose to pin these variables to the top hud as either primary (gold) or secondary (black)
										variables. The author can then create game actions and game triggers to control player interaction with the game variables and to 
										script game behavior.
									</p>
									<p>
										The game itself includes several optional systems such as turn based play, popup notices, and a simple conversation system. 
										These tools allow the author to create very dynamic behavior that can be as simple or as complicated as desired. 
										Additionally, this game is designed for use through several different course management platforms including Canvas and
										Blackboard.
										The game template itself is still in the very early stages of development, but it already shows signs of being one of the more
										versatile game templates offered through Author.

									Challenges In Community Health (CCH) is a custom game template that I built for a hospital administration course.
									Designed to be used with 
									<a href="http://www.muzzylane.com/2015/11/muzzy-lane-author-faq/" target="_blank">Muzzy Lane's Author service</a>,
									CCH is built off of many of the same systems as the generic simulation tool mentioned above (Smart Sim).
									Additionally, CCH has been outfitted with a detailed epidemiological to model an uncontrolled spread of the Flu
									virus through a small town. Gameplay centers around maintaining staff health while also trying to raise awareness
									in the community. These factors affect the lethality and spreading rate of the virus. The model itself is based off of 
									a popular model known as the SIR model (Susceptible -> Infected -> Recovered). CCH modifies this model to include lethality 
									and the inter-mixing of different population groups that experience different viral spreading rates. 
									Included with the game is an editor that I built that allows instructional designers to control simulation and game parameters
									and to create custom content.
								</p>
								<p>
									A graph of the simulation
									results for a sample game is shown here. The graph shows the fraction of the total population that are susceptible, infected,
									recovered, vaccinated, and deceased.

							As a graduate student at the University of Arizona, I used Zeus-MP to simulate accretion disks around
							black holes. Zeus-MP is a popular 3D massively parallel radiation magneto-hydrodynamics code. 
							It was originally developed by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJS...80..753S" target=_blank>Stone and Norman</a>
							and later modified by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..165..188H" target=_blank>Hayes et. al</a> 
							to utilize MPI for parallel computing. 
							By using generic metrics, the equations solved therein are independent of any specific 
							geometry, making the code versatile enough to easily handle different geometries. Additionally, Zeus-MP's
							inclusion of both magnetic fields and radiation makes the code versatile enough to handle many different
							Astrophysical fluids problems. 
						</p> 
						<p>
							Using the hydro and radiation modules of Zeus-MP, we set out to determine what effects
							radiation pressure have on the rates at which black holes devour gas and grow. This project involved an 
							enormous amount of effort to develop a self-consistent model with which to feed gas into the system
							as well as an appropriate way to build the accretion disk while maintaining stability within the code.
						</p>
						<p>
							Using the Steele cluster at Purdue university, I ran several different simulations with varying gas inflow rates
							and free-free emission strengths. The results of one such run are stored 
							<a href="http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~pjenks/fstart/noVisc/f100/k1/" target=_blank>here</a>. The following figure
							and video show the gas inflow rate at ~40 blackhole radii normalized by a theoretical maximum and a log-density plot 
							(with velocity arrow overlays whose lengths are normalized to the speed of light) of the simulation respectively. 
							The video shows a sidelong view of the accretion disk with the
							black hole at the center and the disk along the horizontal axis. The black hole itself features an incredibly turbuluent disk
							(brought on by radiation pressure) and strong outflow along the rotational (vertical) axis.

									All of my personal game projects center around my SDL/OpenGL rendering engine I call Oracle. Oracle is a scene
									based engine written in C++ that uses SDL and OpenGL for both 3D and 2D rendering. It includes utilities for custom
									shaders, texture and model transformations, basic collisions, particles, and a simple UI system consisting of panels, buttons, and
									text entry fields. The video featured here is a tech test of a plane flying around a 3D environment. The user controls the pitch,
									yaw, and roll of the plane to change the direction of travel.

									My biggest project to date using Oracle is a space based strategy game called Reaver. Reaver consists
									of two main scenes. The first is a top level strategy layer consisting of a graph of connected planets where the player can
									purchase ships, travel to different planets, and attack enemy planets. The second is a turn based tactical layer where the
									battles for planets occurs. Turns are taken per ship instead of per player where the order is determined by ship initiative.
									Each ship has two modes of firing and a set speed that determines how far they can move in a turn.

									The videos featured in this section include  gameplay demo of Reaver
									and a gameplay demo of a pseudo-shmup style game. In the shmup demo, the player has several weapon types including a standard projectile,
									triple fire projectile, homing missiles, and a flak launcher. In order to handle collision detection for this game while maintaining
									a roughly 60 fps frame-rate, I built a generic 2D search tree based off of axis aligned bounding boxes. The tree itself is rebalanced
									in a separate thread from the game's main loop while Oracle renders the scene. This search tree is featured in the 'Code Sample' section 
									of this portfolio.

								Simulation

								<p>
									In addition to my interest in gaming, I also have an interest in simulation. The videos shown here show two different simulations
									using an N-Particle simulator that I wrote. The first is a simulation of two colliding galaxies. This simulation shows some nice features
									of a close-by collision including tidal tails. The stars shooting rapidly from the galaxy centers is a the result of a numerical effect.
									This is solved using a softening parameter in the gravitational force calculation, which has been intentionally left out here. The second
									video shows a common Astrophysical problem known as the three-body problem. This simulation illustrates the potentially chaotic behavior
									of three interacting stars.

							The base search tree is designed to handle any 2D search where the search space for a node can be subdivided into 4 quadrants. 
							A value entered into the tree can belong to any number of node quadrants.
							Implementation for specific search and value types is accomplished by overriding a set of pure virtual functions that define
							the behavior of the tree. The specific implementation of the tree using 2D axis aligned bounding boxes and 2D sprites is provided above. 
							In this case, each node
							is represented by a bounding box. When sprites are pushed into the tree, all nodes that overlap with that sprite will either directly hold onto 
							that sprite or subdivide its space into quadrants, creating four new leafs to hold onto its sprites. A specific use of this tree is illustrated
							in the video shown. In this case, all arrows are entered into the search tree. The green arrow is controlled by the player's mouse and the red 
							arrows are the sprites returned by the search tree using the mouse arrow as a test value. These red sprites can then be tested for
							a potentially more expensive collision calculation. The implementation of this scene is also provided.
